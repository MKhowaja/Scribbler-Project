1. What is the objective of your project?
•	Objective of the project is to program a Scribbler S2 robot that will act as a transporter
•	It will carry a specific item to a predetermined destination
•	Once it arrives at the destination it will capture an image in order to keep a record of the recipient, similar to a signature with postal delivery
•	The robot will thereafter navigate back to its starting point
•	The path that the robot will take to its destination will be dynamically determined corresponding to the circumstances of the route 

2. What is the main design challenge in doing the project? 
•	The main design challenge in doing this project is to overcome the hardware limitations that are found on the Scribbler 2.
•	Its sensors seem to barely work and only under optimal lighting conditions. This poses a problem because the objective of our bot is to properly navigate in an area that will have irregular lighting and obstacles
•	Have to find creative workarounds to accommodate the lack of optimal hardware functionality 
•	Keeping track of the Scribbler’s location relative to the room and its orientation relative to the destination as it navigates around obstacles

3. What will you show during the presentation?
•	Our robot will act as an ice cream truck. 
•	It will transport an ice cream cone from one corner of the room to another and return to its starting point
•	It will avoid obstacles along its way (i.e. chairs, desks, backpacks)
•	It will play ice cream truck music. 
•	It will take a picture of the recipient and beep 3 times in order to verify that it has reached the destination 
•	It will then store the image onto the control center (i.e. the computer from which the script is executed)
