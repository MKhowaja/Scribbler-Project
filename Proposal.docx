IceCreamBot (ICB) Proposal

1.	What is the objective of your project?

The objective of the project is to program a Scribbler S2 robot that will act as a transporter with the following functions: 
•	It will carry a specific item to a predetermined destination
•	Once it arrives at the destination it will capture an image in order to keep a record of the recipient, similar to a signature with postal delivery
•	The robot will thereafter navigate back to its starting point
•	The path that the robot will take to its destination will be dynamically determined corresponding to the circumstances of the route 

2.	What is the main design challenge in doing the project? 

•	Main design challenge: Keeping track of the Scribbler’s location relative to the room and its orientation relative to the destination as it navigates around obstacles
•	Its sensors seem to barely work and only under optimal lighting conditions. This poses a problem because the objective of our robot is to properly navigate in an area that will have irregular lighting and obstacles
•	Have to find creative workarounds to accommodate the lack of optimal hardware functionality

3.	What will you show during the presentation?

•	Our robot will act as an ice cream truck. 
•	It will transport an ice cream cone from one corner of the room to another and return to its starting point
•	It will avoid obstacles along its way (i.e. chairs, desks, backpacks)
•	It will play ice cream truck music. 
•	It will take a picture of the recipient and beep 3 times in order to verify that it has reached the destination 
•	It will then store the image onto the control center (i.e. the computer from which the script is executed)
•	The robot will then navigate back to its starting position
